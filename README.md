
# Bitbucket PHP code coverage application

## Description
This repository is for a Bitbucket application designed to work in combination with
the Bitbucket pipe: https://github.com/lalande21185/code-coverage-pipe.

The pipe calculates test code coverage and sends the results to this application, allowing you to view it directly within Bitbucket.

Test code coverage is visible for the main branch in the Bitbucket repository view, as well as on each pull request for both the source and destination branch.

This app is not yet listed on the Bitbucket Marketplace.
To install the app for your Bitbucket repository, please create an issue on GitHub and I will provide a Bitbucket shared installation link.
For more information, see https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/distribute-your-apps/#start-sharing-your-app.


## Install

- Open an issue to request a shared installation link.
- Follow the installation steps within Bitbucket.
- Add the [pipe](https://github.com/lalande21185/code-coverage-pipe) to your pipeline.
