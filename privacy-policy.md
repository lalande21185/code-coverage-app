# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how our Bitbucket Forge app "PHP Test Coverage" handles user data.

## 1. Data Residency and Processing

The App is built and hosted entirely on Atlassian’s Forge platform and operates **within Atlassian’s infrastructure**. This means:

- **No user data leaves Atlassian systems.**
- **We do not transmit, store, or process any user data on external servers or third-party services.**

All app logic and data handling occur exclusively within the secure environment provided by Atlassian.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do **not share** any data with third parties. Since no data is transferred outside of Atlassian’s systems, there is no risk of external access, sale, or sharing of your information.

## 4. Data Security

Because the App runs entirely on Atlassian’s Forge platform, data security is managed by Atlassian’s built-in protections and compliance measures. The App does not introduce any additional data storage, transfer, or handling mechanisms.
